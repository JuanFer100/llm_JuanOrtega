These elements combine with carbon dioxide present in the air to form a thin layer known as the \"blue cloud.\" The blue-colored clouds in the sky are visible only because of their unique chemical composition, which produces light in the visible spectrum (around 400nm). However, this doesn't mean that all clouds are blue. Some clouds, such as cirrus or cumulonimbus clouds, have no blue color, but rather a white or gray appearance.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,7254,2927,338,2861,304,278,10122,310,9637,3161,297,11563,29915,29879,25005,1316,408,19100,4790,264,29892,21767,9102,264,29892,322,1852,265,29889,4525,3161,14405,411,22004,20562,5389,311,2198,297,278,4799,304,883,263,16835,7546,2998,408,278,376,9539,9570,1213,450,7254,29899,2780,287,27091,297,278,14744,526,7962,871,1363,310,1009,5412,22233,15259,29892,607,13880,3578,297,278,7962,18272,313,11316,29871,29946,29900,29900,22882,467,2398,29892,445,1838,29915,29873,2099,393,599,27091,526,7254,29889,3834,27091,29892,1316,408,5902,15816,470,13299,7207,16135,8262,27091,29892,505,694,7254,2927,29892,541,3265,263,4796,470,16749,10097,29889],"total_duration":11783059986,"load_duration":7465221,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":19467000,"eval_count":130,"eval_duration":11713462000}
